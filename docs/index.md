## Introduction

**[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/es/)** has been the greatest innovation and technological, financial, political and social revolution of the 21st century, because for the first time in the history of trade and financial transactions With no cash, users directly regained the power to make drafts and payments completely person-to-person without the need for an intermediary such as a bank or payment processing institution. Bitcoin is like cash where you can pay without the need to register your personal details, it is truly a ** `electronic money system` ** completely peer-to-peer, yet more than a decade has passed since its invention **[(1)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** and the goal of electronic money for everyone has not been met.

Currently only 1% of the planet's population uses or has ever used bitcoin **[(2)](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/es/cuantos-usuarios-bitcoin/)**, which makes us carries a number of 100 million people; However, the number of active users on the bitcoin network is even lower, estimated at around 500,000 a day. This low adoption with respect to the technological potential is due to the technical difficulties inherent to its network such as the fixed block size of 1 MB and the problems of high transaction costs and scalability **[(3)](https://academy.bit2me.com/what-is-bitcoin-scalability/)**. In addition, it should be mentioned that a large part of the bitcoins have been concentrated in the financial markets and speculative markets of Wall Street.

This problem and bottleneck led to the bitcoin network forking in two on **`August 1, 2017`**, giving rise to the bitcoin cash BCH network **[(4)](https://www.bitcoincash.org /)**, which fixed many of the technical and scalability issues. Through BCH, transactions can be processed quickly and at marginal cost completely onchain or directly on the blockchain. In addition, and very important with BCH, the previous concept of colored coins was introduced **[(5)](https://www.oroyfinanzas.com/2015/12/colored-coins-bitcoins-representan-activos-mundo-real/)** using the Simple Ledger or SLP protocol.

With the SLP protocol of bitcoin cash, the initial vision of true electronic cash for everyone was returned again, completely auditable and verifiable since the transactions are carried out directly on the chain of blocks through the special register ** ʻOP_RETURN` * *, which allows transactions for pennies on the dollar. However, with the only SLP protocol the creation of new coins is in charge of the creator of the coin, which does not allow a decentralized payment network that is what has guaranteed the success of Bitcoin. Decentralization is solved with a novel **`Bitcoin Scrypt`** through **`proof of work` **first introduced by **Mistcoin[(6)](https: // mistcoin. org /)**

With all these technological advances and having the vision of true electronic cash for everyone, but especially and keeping in mind the emerging economies that have always lagged behind the main technological innovations, it has been created using the SLP protocol of bitcoin cash with the methodology of Mistcoin the electronic currency ** `Bitcoin Latino BTCL` **.
 

## What is Bitcoin Latino?

Bitcoin Latino BTCL is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer virtual currency or ** “peer to peer P2P” `**, which has been created using the SLP or Simple Ledger Protocol and the ** [(Mistcoin )] (https://mistcoin.org/) ** and works on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. It has been incorporated into the block ** `655223` ** on **` October 1, 2020` ** with the ID: ** `20e8e13347a76f6041bf7d31b04a7bbb7e2deb5d95e15ae8619179b3552ca02a` ** at 9:46 am Atlantic time.

BTCL transactions are processed completely onchain on the top of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain through the special OP_RETURN registration system and can be observed in the special block explorer of ** [Simple Ledger Protocol] (https://simpleledger.info / token / 20e8e13347a76f6041bf7d31b04a7bbb7e2deb5d95e15ae8619179b3552ca02a) ** and in the bitcoin Explorer ** [Bitcoin.com.] (https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/20e8e13347a7b5d95e15ae8619179b3552ca02a) ** and in the bitcoin Explorer ** [Bitcoin.com.] (https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/20e8e13347a776f60b795e8e8e13347a776f60b7954e8e13347a7b31b86ca02e8e13347a76f60b02a

It is a completely open source or open source system where the proof of work or ** `" Proof of Work "` ** is used by means of a simple but novel bitcoin scrypt for the mining of new currencies by means of the ** `" covenant_1 contract of Mist "` **. Anyone can verify and audit the code in the open repository of ** [Mist.] (Https://mistcoin.org/) **

Through Bitcoin Latino, the bitcoin protocol is extended to be used in
